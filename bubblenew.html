<h2>ðŸ¢‚ <u>DEFINITION:-</h2></u>
<p class="solid">Sorting is the process of arranging elements in a specific order based on particular criteria. 
Typically, this order is either ascending (from smallest to largest) or descending (from largest to smallest). 
The elements to be sorted can be numbers, strings, or other data types.<br><u>OR</u><br>
Sorting is the process of arranging data into meaningful order so that you can analyze it more effectively. For example, you might want to order sales data by calendar month so that you can produce a graph of sales performance. You can use Discoverer to sort data as follows: sort text data into alphabetical order.	</p>


<h2>ðŸ¢‚ <u>HISTORY OF SORTING:-</u></h2>
 <p class="solid">
 <strong><u>1970s: Origins and Early Implementations:-</u></strong><br>
 <strong>C Language Creation:</strong> C was developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the early 1970s as part of the development of the UNIX operating system. Sorting algorithms were essential for many system-level tasks.<br>
<strong>Manual Sorting Implementations:</strong> In the early days, C programmers implemented common sorting algorithms manually. The most prevalent algorithms were simple ones like bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort due to their ease of implementation.<br><br>

<strong><u>Late 1970s to 1980s: UNIX and qsort:-</u></strong><br>
<strong>UNIX Influence:</strong> The development of UNIX heavily influenced the development of C. Utilities and libraries written for UNIX often included sorting functionalities.<br>
<strong>Introduction of qsort:</strong> The qsort function, based on the quicksort algorithm, was introduced in UNIX systems. It became a key part of the C standard library due to its flexibility and efficiency.<br><br>

<strong><u>1989: ANSI C Standard (C89/C90):-</u></strong><br>
<strong>ANSI C Standardization:</strong> The ANSI C standard, ratified in 1989, included a standardized version of qsort in the <stdlib.h> library. This was a significant step in unifying C programming practices across different platforms.<br>
<strong>qsort Details: </strong> The qsort function is highly flexible, capable of sorting arrays of any type using a user-provided comparator function. This made it a powerful tool for C programmers.<br><br>

<strong><u>1990s: Optimization and Alternatives:-</u></strong><br>
<strong>Improved Implementations:</strong>  As computing power increased and more research was conducted on sorting algorithms, implementations of qsort were optimized for better performance, especially in terms of handling edge cases and improving average-case performance.<br>
<strong>Alternative Sorting Algorithms: </strong>  Other algorithms like merge sort, heap sort, and hybrid algorithms (e.g., introsort, which combines quicksort, heapsort, and insertion sort) were explored and implemented in various libraries for specific use cases.<br><br>

<strong><u>2000s: Refinement and Specialization:-</u></strong><br>
<strong>Refinements in Libraries:</strong>  Standard libraries and third-party libraries continued to refine sorting implementations for performance and stability. Improvements included better handling of pathological cases in quicksort and optimized memory usage.<br>
<strong>Specialized Sorting:</strong>  Specialized sorting algorithms were developed for particular types of data and hardware. For example, radix sort and counting sort are used for integer sorting, and parallel sorting algorithms were developed for multi-core processors.<br><br>

<strong><u>2010s to Present:- Parallelism and Modern Approaches</u></strong><br>
<strong>C11 Standard: </strong> The C11 standard, published in 2011, continued to include qsort but also introduced new features that facilitated the implementation of parallel algorithms. Although qsort itself was not parallelized, these features allowed for the development of parallel sorting routines.<br>
<strong>Third-Party Libraries:</strong>  Modern third-party libraries often provide their own sorting functions, optimized for specific scenarios, data types, and hardware architectures. Examples include the GNU C Library (glibc) and Intel's Math Kernel Library (MKL).<br>
<strong>Continued Research and Development:</strong>Research into sorting algorithms continues, influencing the implementation of new and more efficient sorting routines in C and other programming languages
