            <h3>Bubble Sort Algorithm</h3>
            <p>Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.</p>
            <h4>Usage of Bubble Sort</h4>

                    <strong>Educational Purposes:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Introduction to Algorithms:</strong> Bubble Sort is often one of the first sorting algorithms taught in computer science courses due to its simple logic and ease of implementation.</li>
                        <li><strong>Understanding Complexity:</strong> It provides a practical example for discussing time complexity, particularly O(nÂ²) in the worst and average cases.</li>
                        <li><strong>Step-by-Step Execution:</strong> Its step-by-step process of comparing and swapping adjacent elements helps students visualize the sorting process.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                    <strong>Small Data Sets:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Efficiency on Small Arrays:</strong> For very small data sets, Bubble Sort can be relatively efficient due to its minimal overhead.</li>
                        <li><strong>Easy to Implement:</strong> Its simple implementation makes it suitable for quick-and-dirty solutions where the data set size is known to be small and performance is not critical.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Nearly Sorted Data:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Adaptive Nature:</strong> Bubble Sort can perform well if the array is nearly sorted (only a few elements are out of place) because it can detect sorted sequences early and terminate.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Pre-processing Stage:</strong> Bubble Sort can be used as a preprocessing step in more complex algorithms or as a part of a larger sorting strategy.</li>
                        <li><strong>Debugging and Testing:</strong> Due to its straightforward implementation, Bubble Sort can be a quick tool for verifying correctness in other algorithms or applications where sorting is needed in a limited context.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                        <li><strong>Looping and Conditionals:</strong> Bubble Sort reinforces fundamental programming concepts such as loops (iterative structures) and conditionals (decision-making), making it a useful exercise in introductory programming courses.</li>
                        <li><strong>Problem-Solving Skills:</strong> Implementing Bubble Sort encourages students to think critically about optimization and efficiency, even if Bubble Sort itself is not efficient for large datasets.</li>
