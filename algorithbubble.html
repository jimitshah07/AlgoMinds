 <h1><u> Algorithm </u></h1><br/>
 <p><h2><b> Manual Run Through
Before we implement the Bubble Sort algorithm in a programming language,<br/> let's manually run through a short array only one time, just to get the idea.</b></h2></p>

<p><h3>Step 1: We start with an unsorted array.</h3></p>
<h3>[7, 12, 9, 11, 3]</h3>
<br/><h3>Step 2: We look at the two first values. Does the lowest value come first? Yes, so we don't need to swap them.</h3>
<h3>[7, 12, 9, 11, 3]</h3>
<br/><h3>Step 3: Take one step forward and look at values 12 and 9. Does the lowest value come first? No.</h3>
<h3>[7, 12, 9, 11, 3]</h3>
<br/><h3>Step 4: So we need to swap them so that 9 comes first.</h3>
<h3>[7, 9, 12, 11, 3]</h3>
<br/><h3>Step 5: Taking one step forward, looking at 12 and 11.</h3>
<h3>[7, 9, 12, 11, 3]</h3>
<br/><h3>Step 6: We must swap so that 11 comes before 12.</h3>
<h3>[7, 9, 11, 12, 3]</h3>
<br/><h3>Step 7: Looking at 12 and 3, do we need to swap them? Yes.</h3>
<h3>[7, 9, 11, 12, 3]</h3>
<br/><h3>Step 8: Swapping 12 and 3 so that 3 comes first.</h3>
<h3>[7, 9, 11, 3, 12]</p></h3>
